      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hows it going, my name is Dutch Foy (yes it's on my birth certificate) I was born on St. Croix, and lived there until about 8 or 9 years of age before moving to California. I have had all types of jobs, from retail on Rodeo Drive, multiple positions at American Airlines; including flight attendant, (I have stamp completed one passport). I am US NAVY vet, and currently a licensed hairstylist. I attended college and shamefully quit a few units away from receiving my AA. I would like to leave Code Fellows with a strong foundation with coding, and computers so I am confident in my career search thereafter. </p>
